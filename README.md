# FCC Javascript Calculator

The aim is to build a functioning calculator with javascript frontend-libararies.

## [Online Demo](https://jwhodge.github.io/javascript-calculator/)

 The basic technologies used thus far are:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React

The assignment brief is available here: [FCC Calculator Assignment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)

## Design Notes
I've taken a [glassmorphism](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/glassmorphism-design-effect-with-html-css/) approach with the css. In terms of the React functionality I'm yet to finalise the exact structure of the code.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
